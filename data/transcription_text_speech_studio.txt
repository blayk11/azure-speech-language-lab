Bitcoin represents something totally new that has never existed and that is decentralized money that runs on the Internet that you don't need to trust any third party to hold or use. You basically can choose to hold it by holding a private key. You can either memorize it in your head, have it on a piece of paper, put it on a hardware wallet, or you can trust the third party like Abra or crypto exchange or bank to hold to hold your Bitcoin. That's Bitcoin and. Nothing else. You can move it between two people, You can hold it. That's all it does. It's really meant to act as like a digital gold and eventually act as the base layer for a new monetary system.
